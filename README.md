# IRIS_Classification

I uploaded the dataset to a Google Colab after downloading it from Kaggle. After that, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis and looked for null values. Since there weren't any, I moved on to the data visualisation stage. I used box plots, pair plots, and heat maps to visualise my data and look for correlations. Next, I used the KNN Classification method , SVM Classification , Decision Tree , Logistic Regression to train my model.
0.973	KNN
0.947	Decision Tree
0.921	Logistic Regression
0.894	Support Vector Machines. 
So I prefer to use KNN classification.
